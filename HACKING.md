Hacking guidelines
==================

1. Code style
-------------

1.1 Tab Width
-------------

It's preferable to keep your tab with as 2 spaces (and no \t).

1.2 Method Parenthesis
----------------------

It is obligatory for parenthesis to be included in all methods that take two or more arguments. Exceptions to this rule are methods that take a Hash as an argument. Then you aren't supposed to use parenthesis.
